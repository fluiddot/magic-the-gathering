# <a id="React_Native_0"></a>Simple React Native UI for listing Magic The Gathering cards.

- Simple app that basically lists all the cards of Magic The Gathering and displays some information
- The project has been created with [Expo](https://expo.io). Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React
- Magic The Gathering provides an awesome API for fetching the [data](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/)
- The app has been checked only on web device, not ios and android

For this project, I have used Expo to crete an architecture based on components made with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
I have used [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) instead of classes in order to have a more scalable code.
I have used [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for unit testing of the components.
